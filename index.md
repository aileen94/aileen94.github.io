 > ´You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making.
 > As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic.
 > I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes,
 > the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . .
 > I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — 
 > if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.'
